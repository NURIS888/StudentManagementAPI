What is the "Student Management" project?
It is a digital system that stores all the necessary information about all the students in an educational institution. Essentially, it is an electronic card file that contains details about each studentâ€”such as their first name, last name, date of birth, and all their current grades.

What does this system give you to do?

*Add new students to the system: This means that entering information about new students into the system as they enroll in the educational institution.
*View information about students: This means to find a specific student in the system by their name, last name, major, etc., and viewing all their information.
*Update information: This means updating a student's information, for instance, if they move to a new address or change their phone number.
*Filter data: This means generating a list of students that meet certain criteria. For example, all students enrolled in a specific program or all students who have outstanding debts.
*Delete student records: This means removing a student's record and data from the system when they graduate or leave the institution.
