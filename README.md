What is "Student Management" as a project?

It is an electronic database of all the students in any educational institution with all the essential details. In a nutshell, it is like a student card index which contains primary data about the student such as first name, last name, date of birth and all their registered course marks.

What does this system permit you?

*Register other students: This entails entering new studentsâ€™ details into the system when they join the school.

*Search: This allows searching for a particular student within the system by name, the last name, the faculty, the program of study, etc. and having access to their data.

*Change information: This implies the modification of particulars relating to a student, for example, a change of address or a phone number.

*Data retrieval: This implies constructing a student list based on the requirements. For instance, a list of students studying in a particular course or a list of students with outstanding balances.

*Student deletion: This means the record of the student is exited from the system so as to avoid misleading information when a student leaves the institution or when a student completes his or her program of study.
